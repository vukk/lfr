    "Now we can define a mapping from the original dataset $\\mathbf{X}$ to probabilities via the *softmax function*. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function):\n",
    "> Softmax function \"squashes\" a $K$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{z}$ of arbitrary real values to a $K$-dimensional vector $\\sigma(\\mathbf{z})$ of real values in the range $[0, 1]$ that add up to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notably `softmax` returns a probability vector. We will define a modified version that maps a $D$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x}$ to a $K$-dimensional vector $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})$, i.e. the mapping won't necessarily preserve the dimensionality of $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression):\n",
    "> $$\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\frac{e^{x_k}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}}$$\n",
    "> is referred to as the [*softmax function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function).  The reason is that the effect of exponentiating the values $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ is to exaggerate the differences between them.  As a result, $\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ will return a value close to 0 whenever $x_k$ is significantly less than the maximum of all the values, and will return a value close to 1 when applied to the maximum value, unless it is extremely close to the next-largest value.  Thus, the softmax function can be used to construct a weighted average that behaves as a smooth function (which can be conveniently differentiated, etc.) and which approximates the [indicator function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we define, as in the paper equation (2), $$\\mathbb{P}(Z=k \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{e^{-d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}_k)}}{\\sum_{j=1}^K e^{-d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}_j)}}$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{P}(Z=k \\mid \\mathbf{x})$ is described in [definitions](#Definitions)\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{x}$ is the datapoint\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{v}_k$ is a vector associated with the $k$th prototype\n",
    "- $d$ is a distance measure between $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_k$ (e.g. the euclidean distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that since we have replaced $x_k$ in the softmax with the negative distance between $\\mathbf{x}$ and prototype $\\mathbf{v}_k$, the softmax returns a value close to 0 whenever the distance from $\\mathbf{x}$ to the prototype $\\mathbf{v}_k$ is significantly higher than $\\min_{j\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}}\\, d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}_i)$, and close to 1 when applied to the minimum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mapping from X to Z\" in the paper means mapping the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ to a probability vector $\\mathbf{z}$ of length $K$ via the softmax function. These probability vectors are then used directly for training the classifier."

Whether this is computationally still feasible is another question. In the objective function $L_z$ is replaced by $A_{z_1} \\cdot L_{z_1} + A_{z_2} \\cdot L_{z_2} + \\dots + A_{z_c} \\cdot L_{z_c}$.\n",

This is because we are using statistical parity. This means that from the algorithm's perspective saying that group0 is non-protected and groups 1..4 are protected is the same as saying group1 is protected and other non-protected."
