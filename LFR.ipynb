    "> Softmax function \"squashes\" a $K$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{z}$ of arbitrary real values to a $K$-dimensional vector $\\sigma(\\mathbf{z})$ of real values in the range $[0, 1]$ that add up to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notably `softmax` returns a probability vector. We will define a modified version that maps a $D$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x}$ to a $K$-dimensional vector $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})$, i.e. the mapping won't necessarily preserve the dimensionality of $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",

    "> is referred to as the [*softmax function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function).  The reason is that the effect of exponentiating the values $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ is to exaggerate the differences between them.  As a result, $\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ will return a value close to 0 whenever $x_k$ is significantly less than the maximum of all the values, and will return a value close to 1 when applied to the maximum value, unless it is extremely close to the next-largest value.  Thus, the softmax function can be used to construct a weighted average that behaves as a smooth function (which can be conveniently differentiated, etc.) and which approximates the [indicator function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function).\n",

    "So we define, as in the paper equation (2), $$\\mathbb{P}(Z=k \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{e^{-d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}_k)}}{\\sum_{j=1}^K e^{-d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}_j)}}$$\n",

    "- $d$ is a distance measure between $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_k$ (e.g. the euclidean distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that since we have replaced $x_k$ in the softmax with the negative distance between $\\mathbf{x}$ and prototype $\\mathbf{v}_k$, the softmax returns a value close to 0 whenever the distance from $\\mathbf{x}$ to the prototype $\\mathbf{v}_k$ is significantly higher than $\\min_{j\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}}\\, d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}_i)$, and close to 1 when applied to the minimum value.\n",

They all have in common a dependent variable to be predicted that comes from one of a limited set of items which cannot be meaningfully ordered, as well as a set of independent variables (also known as features, explanators, etc.), which are used to predict the dependent variable. Multinomial logit regression is a particular solution to the classification problem that assumes that a linear combination of the observed features and some problem-specific parameters can be used to determine the probability of each particular outcome of the dependent variable. The best values of the parameters for a given problem are usually determined from some training data.\n"

    "- Let's say that there is a column/feature \"Religion\" in the dataset.\n",

    "- You have to decide what is the \"protected\" group, and what is the \"normal/non protected\" group. You have to decide based on some external criteria who are discriminated against and who are not.\n",
    "- Let's say we have a dataset with a feature \"Religion\" and we have 5 different religions represented.\n",
    "- Now we have to choose which ones are protected and which ones are not.\n",
    "- The problem of course is that some might be in general discriminated against more than others. There is not necessary even split between the different groups that are discriminated against.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What we would like to say is that \"Religion\" is a sensitive feature, and we should not infer _anything_ from it, regardless what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does running the algo multiple times help, changing the binary classification each time? Can we extend it so that $S \\in {1,...,C}$ where $C$ is the number of categories in the sensitive column.\n",
    "  - We can extend, just split $L_z$ to multiple cases and the optimization is done to all of them. There will be $c = \\frac{(C-1)C}{2} \\approx O(C^2)$ pairs. Whether this is computationally still feasible is another question. In the objective function $L_z$ is replaced by $A_{z_1} \\cdot L_{z_1} + A_{z_2} \\cdot L_{z_2} + \\dots + A_{z_c} \\cdot L_{z_c}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the current case where $S \\in \\left\\{0,1\\right\\}$ once we have set for which rows $S=1$ and $S=0$, we can flip them around without changing anything. This is because we are using statistical parity. This means that from the algorithm's perspective saying that group0 is non-protected and groups 1..4 are protected is the same as saying group1 is protected and other non-protected."
